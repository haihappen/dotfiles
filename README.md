These are config files and commands to set up a system the way I like it.

```sh
$ ip [-e] # Returns current (Wi-fi) IP address or current external IP address.
```

```sh
$ cb # Returns clipboard content.
$ ls | cb # Sets clipboard content.
```

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/haihappen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles && rake
```

You can remove them easily too!

```sh
$ cd ~/.dotfiles && rake uninstall
$ cd ~ && rm -rf ~/.dotfiles
```
